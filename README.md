## Summary
---
- This repository is a summary of all of my work on Advent of Code challenges.
- The structure exists locally and will be pushed as files are created per year.
- There is a single folder for each year, containing folders for each individual language I am completing the year in.
- Within each subfolder for languages, there will be a folder for each individual day.
